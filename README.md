# Tripmate
Tripmate Backend Rest API: A Smart group Travel Platform
## ðŸ“Š Performance Benchmark

TripMate backend was tested using **Locust** with authenticated GET endpoints for a general user role.

### Summary Metrics
- **Average Latency:** ~862 ms
- **P50 Latency:** ~120 ms (typical request)
- **P95 Latency:** ~390 ms (worst 5% of requests)
- **Max Latency:** ~1.2 s
- **Throughput:** ~52 req/sec on local environment
- **Error Rate:** 0%

### Endpoint Performance Highlights
| Endpoint | Avg Latency (ms) | P95 (ms) | Max (ms) | Notes |
|----------|------------------|----------|----------|-------|
| `/health` | 162 | 180 | 200 | Lightweight health check |
| `/trips/view-trips` | 779 | 820 | 840 | Cached endpoint |
| `/itinerary/trip/16` | 99 (miss) â†’ 60 (hit) | â€” | â€” | 39% cache improvement |
| `/expenses/trips/1/settlements` | 1,206 | 1,240 | 1,260 | DB heavy, candidate for optimization |

### Caching Impact
Tested on:
- `/trips/view-trips`
- `/trips/16`
- `/itinerary/trip/16`

| Endpoint | Miss (ms) | Hit (ms) | Improvement |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `/itinerary/trip/16` | 99.75 | 60.31 | **+39.54% faster** |
| `/trips/view-trips` | 30.40 | 50.58 | -66.41% |
| `/trips/16` | 50.08 | 50.16 | ~0% |

> Note: Negative/zero improvement indicates small payloads where caching overhead may outweigh DB retrieval time.
